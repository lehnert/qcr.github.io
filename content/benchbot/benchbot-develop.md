The Semantic Scene Understanding (development) is a set of Unreal Engine environments for use with the [BenchBot software stack](http://benchbot.org) in the [ACRV Semantic Scene Understanding Challenge](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/625/overview). A collage of the robot starting position for each of the environments is shown below:

Features of the dataset include:

- a total of 10 different environments
- 2 different places: a small apartment room, and a Scandinavian house
- each place has 5 different variations
- between variations there are changes in lighting, time of day, starting location, robot trajectory, and object placements
