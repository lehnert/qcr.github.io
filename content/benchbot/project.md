description: |
  The BenchBot software stack is a collection of software packages that allow end users to control robots in real or simulated environments with a simple python API. It leverages the simple "observe, act, repeat" approach to robot problems prevalent in reinforcement learning communities (OpenAI Gym users will find the BenchBot API interface very similar).
