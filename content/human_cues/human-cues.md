The Human Cues for Robot Navigation ARC Discovery project (DP140103216) investigated how a robot can navigate using the same navigation cues humans use when navigating built environments. Types of navigation cues targeted include labels, directional signs, signboards, maps & floor plans, navigational gestures, and spoken directions & descriptions. The main contribution from this work is the abstract map, a navigational tool that allows a robot to employ symbolic spatial information in its navigation of unseen spaces.
