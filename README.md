# QCR Open Source Website

This repository holds the QCR open source website; a central place where the [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/) lists all of its code and datasets available for the community.

The site is designed to make it easy for any member of the QCR (and affiliated members) to share their projects with the community under the QCR banner. In turn, we hope that the community can grow to identify this as the go-to place to look for novel state-of-the-art open source robotics software and datasets.

Adding your content to the site shouldn't require any more than adding data about your projects to the `*.yaml` files, and adding your content in the form of `*.md` files and/or images. Once you commit and push, this site will rebuild and update the hosted content in the background using GitHub Actions.
