  name: BenchBot
  description: |
    The BenchBot software stack is a collection of software packages that allow end users to control robots in real or simulated environments with a simple python API. It leverages the simple "observe, act, repeat" approach to robot problems prevalent in reinforcement learning communities (OpenAI Gym users will find the BenchBot API interface very similar).

  name: Human Cues for Robot Navigation
  description: |
    The Human Cues for Robot Navigation ARC Discovery project (DP140103216) investigated how a robot can navigate using the same navigation cues humans use when navigating built environments. Types of navigation cues targeted include labels, directional signs, signboards, maps & floor plans, navigational gestures, and spoken directions & descriptions. The main contribution from this work is the abstract map, a navigational tool that allows a robot to employ symbolic spatial information in its navigation of unseen spaces.
